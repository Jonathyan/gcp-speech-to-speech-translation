# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Translation System

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Product Vision
A browser-based real-time speech translation system that enables Dutch speakers to communicate seamlessly in English through instant voice translation, designed for educational and professional environments.

### Current Status
- **Version**: 1.0.0-minimal (Phase 3 simplified architecture)
- **Stage**: Production deployed on Google Cloud Run
- **Performance**: Functional but suboptimal (2.5s latency, 43% word capture rate)

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Primary Problem
Dutch-speaking professionals and students need to participate in English-language meetings, lectures, and conversations but face language barriers that limit their communication effectiveness.

### Current Pain Points
1. **Lost Words**: System currently loses ~57% of spoken words due to 2-second chunking
2. **High Latency**: 2.5-second delay makes natural conversation difficult
3. **Fast Speakers**: Cannot handle speakers over 100 words per minute
4. **Long Sentences**: Truncates or loses content in sentences over 2 seconds

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Church members with other native languages listening to church services
- **Secondary**: Dutch-speaking professionals in international companies
- **Tertiary**: Students attending English-language courses
- **Quartary**: Conference interpreters and translators
